### How to provide a photo
1. Option A — Local file (recommended): copy your photo file into the project's `images/` folder and name it `profile.jpg` or `profile.png`.
   - On Windows: copy the image into `C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\web.siteL\images`.
   - Then update `about.html` and `index.html` src to `images/profile.jpg`.
2. Option B — Remote URL: give me the direct image URL and I will update the HTML to reference it.
3. Option C — Upload via GitHub: create a commit that adds your photo to the `images/` folder (you can upload directly on GitHub web UI) and I will update the files to point to it.

If you want, I can add the image for you now — either paste the file here (if the environment supports uploads) or provide a direct image URL.
